\section{Consume The Opponent's Movement Space}

Favor moves where the player encroaches on the opponent's moves or follow them around
the board. Also uses the idea of trying to stop an opponent that suddenly has limited movement.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
		playerMoves = game.get_legal_moves(player)
		opponentMoves = game.get_legal_moves(game.get_opponent(player))
		if len(opponentMoves) == 1:
				for o in opponentMoves:
						for p in playerMoves:
								if o == p:
										return float("+inf")

		matchedMoves = 0
		centerAt = board_center(game)
		for o in opponentMoves:
				for p in playerMoves:
						if o == p:
								matchedMoves += 10
		if matchedMoves > 0:
				return float(matchedMoves)

		playerAt = game.get_player_location(player)
		opponentAt = game.get_player_location(game.get_opponent(player))

		xDiff = playerAt[0] - opponentAt[0]
		yDiff = playerAt[1] - opponentAt[1]
		denom = float(xDiff*xDiff + yDiff*yDiff)
		if denom == 0:
				return float("+inf")
		return float(1.0/denom)
\end{lstlisting}

Seeing that the value drops below 75\% is not encouraging.

\section{Remain Near The Center}

Favor moves that position the player closer to the center of the board.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]

		playerAt = game.get_player_location(player)

		xDiff = playerAt[0] - centerAt[0]

This ends up being the most disappointing set of results.  This is clearly not
a winning strategy.

\section{Central Hover Followed By Most Moves}

Favor moves that position the player closer to the center of the board until the game board is 40\% full.
Otherwise, simply move as ID Improved would giving heavy weight on a set of moves that can pinch an opponent.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
		blanks = game.get_blank_spaces()
		if len(blanks) > (3*game.width*game.height/5):
				centerAt = board_center(game)
				playerAt = game.get_player_location(player)
				xDiff = playerAt[0] - centerAt[0]
				yDiff = playerAt[1] - centerAt[1]
				denom = float(xDiff*xDiff + yDiff*yDiff)
				if denom == 0:
						return float("+inf")
				return float(1.0/denom)

		playerMoves = game.get_legal_moves(player)
		opponentMoves = game.get_legal_moves(game.get_opponent(player))
		if len(opponentMoves) == 1:
				for o in opponentMoves:
						for p in playerMoves:
								if o == p:
										return float("+inf")

		return float(len(game.get_legal_moves(player))-
			len(game.get_legal_moves(game.get_opponent(player))))
\end{lstlisting}

This is the first time one of my heuristics has outperformed ID Improved.  Considering that this
is a variation of ID Improved's heuristic, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised that it is highly competitive.

\section{Results}

The ID Improved heuristic consistently achieves scores from 75-78\% based on testing.

Among all four contenders, "Central Hover Followed by Most Moves" appears to be the best option.
By initially remaining near the center of the board, it seems
that this should allow for more available moves, permitting more possibility for finding a winning branch.
I like the idea of coming up with strategies that highly favor being able to see "horizon" results 
before they happen, unfortunately I am not sure how to do that in an isolation scenario with chess-like knight movement.
As such, highly favoring a single move that includes the possibility of taking the opponent's final move
is where my strategy stopped in that regard.  Naturally, given that the original ID Improved heuristic
was difficult for me to overcome, incorporating it into a more detailed strategy felt like a good approach.

\section{Beyond Project Scope - Breaking Changes}

The following results were obtained by changing the way that the iterative deepening
evaluates layers above depth == 1.  If one makes the changes below so that greater than and
less than comparisons become strictly greater or strictly less than, the search space is
expanded but the win percentages increase.  Doing this will result in the agent\_test.py
failing so I have not included it in my final result, but this was an interesting accidental
discovery.  This version seems superior particularly since it gives one of the highest win percentages
that any of my testing has yet seen.  Both agents ran with the default ID Improved heuristic.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# evaluate all branches and return the highest/lowest scoring tuple
for m in legal_moves:
	if current_move == (-1, -1):
		current_move = m

	if maximizing_player:
		...
		# CHANGED if score >= beta:
		if score > beta:
		...
	else:	
		...
		# CHANGED if score <= alpha:
		if score < alpha:
		...
\end{lstlisting}
